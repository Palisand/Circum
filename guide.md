# Circum Game Guide

### Objective
Change the color of all the white orbs to your color.

### Controls
SPACE - Launch / Tether

### Stuff players should learn by themselves
- Pressing SPACE while orbiting will launch you.
  - You launch tangent to your orbit.
- Pressing SPACE while "in the air" will tether you to the nearest orb.
- You change an orb's color on impact.
  - Color changing works both ways, so you can't just fire-and-forget.
- You can tether onto any orb.
- While tethered to a white orb, you will be drawn to it.
- The more orbs there are, the greater the chance of accidentally bumping into an already-changed orb.
  - This also goes for the amount of orbs that are not stationary.

### Orb Behavior Level Progression
- Stationary
- Stationary and fixed-orbit
- Fixed-orbit
- Stationary and random
- Random

Orb amount increases during each set of levels and resets to some minumum once the next set is introduced.
